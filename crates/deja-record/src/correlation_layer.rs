//! Tracing layer that mirrors a request's correlation id into the ambient
//! deja-context, so boundary events fired from spawned tasks inherit the request
//! correlation instead of recording as uncorrelated.
//!
//! # Why a tracing layer (not tokio task hooks)
//!
//! The middleware wraps the request future in `scope_correlation`, so every
//! boundary that fires synchronously within a poll of that future is attributed.
//! But work moved onto a `tokio::spawn`ed task escapes that wrapper. Hyperswitch
//! runs handlers on actix's per-worker runtimes, which the main `#[tokio::main]`
//! runtime builder does not own — so tokio's task-lifecycle hooks cannot reach
//! them. A tracing layer can: hyperswitch already propagates the request span
//! into spawned tasks via `.in_current_span()`, and a layer's `on_enter` fires
//! wherever the task is polled, on any runtime.
//!
//! # Mechanism (lock-light hot path)
//!
//! `on_new_span` resolves the span's correlation ONCE — from its own `request_id`
//! field, else inherited from the parent's already-resolved value — and stores it
//! in the span's extensions. That is the only extension *write*, and it happens
//! once per span (the same shape the execution-graph layer uses safely).
//!
//! The per-poll hot path stays lock-light: `on_enter` does a brief extension
//! *read* of the pre-resolved value, enters it into deja-context, and parks the
//! restore guard on a **thread-local stack**; `on_exit` pops that stack. No
//! per-poll extension writes and no parent-walk. Because an `Instrumented` future
//! enters/exits its span on every poll, the context is re-established per-poll on
//! whichever worker thread polls the task — correct under tokio work-stealing.

///
/// # Limitations (why this is GRACEFUL DEGRADATION, not a guarantee)
///
/// The layer is installed unfiltered, so the path captures EVERY ambient `tracing`
/// span (framework, library, and `#[instrument]` spans), root→leaf. Two consequences:
///
///  * **Not robust to span-structure edits.** Adding, removing, or renaming ANY
///    enclosing instrumented span on V2 (e.g. a function rename — which renames its
///    default span — or an extracted helper) changes the path string, so the rank-2
///    `LogicalContext` key misses on V2 and the call demotes to rank-3 `SyntacticHash`
///    (still line/signature-independent) or weaker. That is no WORSE than pre-P3
///    behavior; `args_hash` still guards distinct-arg correctness. So a benign edit
///    that leaves the span structure intact (a pure line shift) keeps rank-2; one that
///    reshapes spans falls back gracefully.
///  * **Disambiguates by span NAME, not instance.** Two concurrently-entered DISTINCT
///    span instances that share a name (e.g. two parallel tasks each entering an
///    identically-named span within one correlation) collapse to the SAME path and
///    SAME bucket — the residual "case C" that needs a finer, distinctly-named
///    `#[instrument]` span to resolve (a follow-up, not handled here). The headline
///    case (`update_payment_attempt` vs `update_payment_intent`) has distinct names
///    and IS disambiguated.
///
/// (`None` frames from spurious enters are elided here; two stacks differing only by
/// elided `None`s collapse to the same path — harmless given the limitations above.)
