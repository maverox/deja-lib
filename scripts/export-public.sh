# Fresh-history export for publishing Déjà.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS — the development clone's git history contains material that
# must never be published, and `git rm --cached` cannot remove history:
#   * a real Stripe TEST key inside historical recording blobs and a deleted
#     demo/.env  (ROTATE THE KEY BEFORE PUBLISHING, even with this export);
#   * ~600 MB of accidental payload (cargo target/, benchmark artifacts,
#     harness-state recordings, two full vendored Hyperswitch snapshots);
#   * internal branch/session names and "saving work" commit messages.
# A fresh single-commit export sidesteps all of it: the published repo starts
# from the cleaned tree only (~a few MB), with none of the old blobs reachable.
#
#   Usage: scripts/export-public.sh <destination-dir> [public-repo-url]
#
# The export contains the CURRENT COMMITTED TREE of this branch (tracked files
# only — untracked/ignored state like demo/.env, harness-state, banks never
# copies). The nested vendor/hyperswitch-deja-clean repo is NOT exported here:
# publish its `deja-integration` branch separately (it is a fork of upstream
# Hyperswitch; push ONLY that branch, never deja-lean).
